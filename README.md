# Space Station Management System
<p align="r"><b>A database management system to manage space stations from base station. Inspired by ISS!</b><br>
The International Space Station (ISS) is a modular space station (habitable artificial
satellite) in lower earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan),
ESA (Europe)and CSA (Canada).<br>
The station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in astrobiology,
astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields. The data that is being handled in
space research organisation is enormous and need to be spontaneous. Tracking and Data
Relay Satellite (TDRS) system will transfer the required details from space station to base
station but this data needs to be stored and managed by the admin to be accessed for
various purposes.<br> Thus, it requires an efficient, systematic and non-redundant database
management system. The user who is in charge of handling the database (admin) can
add, remove, update or search for details in database. This system helps in developing a systematic record of various expeditions, life support system levels, space station
maintenance and condition which is very critical for a space research organization.</p><br>
This project is aimed at developing a Space Management System. It is a system that is
designed to maintain all the details regarding Admin, Space Station details which includes
component details,crew details,base station details. We have developed it using HTML,
CSS and PHP. It will reduce the paperwork and hence reducing the manpower.<br><br>
